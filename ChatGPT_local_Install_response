How would I run GPT-3 entirely locally on my computer with no internet access?

It is not currently possible to run GPT-3 entirely locally on your computer without internet access. GPT-3 is a large language model that is hosted by OpenAI, and it requires an internet connection to make API requests to the model.

If you want to use GPT-3 for offline text generation on your computer, you will need to find a way to connect to the internet and make API requests to the GPT-3 endpoint.

One option you might consider is to use a smaller language model that can be run locally on your computer. OpenAI has released several smaller language models that can be installed and used locally, including GPT, GPT-2, and GPT-3 Lite. These models are not as powerful as the full GPT-3 model, but they may be sufficient for your needs and can be run entirely locally on your computer.

To use a smaller language model locally on your computer, you will need to do the following:

Install the OpenAI Python library on your computer by running the following command: pip install openai
Download the model weights and save them to a local directory.
Use the OpenAI Python library to load the model weights and generate text using the openai.api_key and openai.Model.from_file() functions.
Here is an example of how you might use GPT-2 locally on your computer in a Python script:

--Copy code
import openai

# The model to use (change this to the model you want to use)
model_engine = "davinci"

# The directory where the model weights are stored
model_directory = "path/to/model/directory"

# Load the model
model = openai.Model.from_file(model_directory)

# The prompt to generate text from
prompt = "What is the weather like today?"

# Set the completions options
completions = openai.Completion.create(
    engine=model_engine,
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=1024,
    n=1,
    stop=None,
    temperature=0.5,
    model=model
)

# Get the generated text
message = completions.choices[0].text

# Print the generated text
print(message)
This code will load the GPT-2 model from the local directory and use it to generate text based on the prompt. You can then use the generated text in your own application or server.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
